# JSONPlaceholder Blog

This is a simple blog app that I created with React and Redux as part of [Stephen Grider's](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) Modern React with Redux course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). Supported by [JSONPlaceholder's API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), it displays a list of posts created by a list of users.
